# Tasks Board
Using NextJS, React, and any SQL database, develop a full stack solution for a Board with 4 columns:  `BACKLOG` `TODO` `DOING` `DONE`

## Considerations:
* Cards can only be moved by one column in any direction.
* There can only be two cards in DOING at any time
* Once in Done, cards cannot go back
* Moving cards to DONE will trigger a confirmation dialog
* All actions on the board must be validated at least server-side
* Board to be stored in Local Storage


## What we value
* Simple design
    * SOLID
    * KISS
    * DRY
* Effective Architectural and design decisions
    * Separating business rules from infrastructure details
* REST api design
* Testing Strategy
    * Provide the right amount of unit/integration/end-to-end tests following the testing pyramid or any principle you choose.
* Straightforward setup and execution
